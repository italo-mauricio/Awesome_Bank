* Age: 24 years old
* Period: 2nd

## Features:

- ✅ User registration
- ✅ Bank statement
- ✅ Service registration
- ✅ Currency converter
- ✅ Deposit and withdrawal options

## Installing Python:

* To install Python on your computer is very simple.

Windows Users:

      https://www.python.org/downloads/
      
Linux Users:
      
* Step 1:
      
      $ sudo apt-get install python3
    
* Step 2:

      $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    
 Outher Way:
 
* Step 1:
 
      $ sudo yum install python3
     
* Step 2:

      $ yum -y install python3-pip
      

## Python Libraries Used:

- Os: Operating System Interface ✅
- Datetime: Basic date and time types ✅
- Json: JSON encoder and decoder ✅
- Requests: HTTP library for Python ✅
- Prettytable: Easily displaying tabular data in a visually appealing ASCII table format ✅
- CurrencyConverter: Python library for live currency and exchange rate ✅
- Pickle: Python object serialization and deserialization ✅
- Library used for the API request to check currency exchange rates ✅

First Step:

      pip install requests
      
Second Step:

      import requests
    


All modules use librarie Os:

       import os
       
  
The module "CustomerBase.py" uses the "pickle" library.:
       
       import pickle
    
## Development IDE:

* Description: The project was fully developed using Visual Studio, and all of its functionalities were tested on it.

## Development Operating System:

* Description: The project was initially developed on Windows 10, however its functionalities work on Linux as well, with the caveat that the "cls" command in the Os library needs to be changed to "clear" for those who use it on Linux.

## General Project Data:

# Project's Goal:

* This is an independent project by the author that aims to train basic Python CRUDs. It consists of a simple program that is subdivided into interconnected modules. This project aims to teach other beginners in programming how to develop Python-based CRUDs.

* That's why I made everything public and with the MIT license, so that it can be shared and taught to others. I also left my contacts in case other people want tips and explanations about the development of the project. I will be available to answer any questions.


# Methods:

* The project uses several libraries and functionalities. But first... what is CRUD? :sweat:

Definition of CRUD: it comes from the combination of the words (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and it is basically an interconnected menu where the user can register people or things, update, read, and delete them. In the programming world, I would say that it is essential for a programmer to know how to develop a good CRUD because it is very important for the job market.

* Now that we know what CRUD means, let's move on to the methods used:

- Dictionaries for saving in binary files ✅ 
- API ✅ 
- Modern formatting of the language ✅ 
- Efficient data processing method ✅ 
- Use of clases ✅ 
- Program that is completely readable and written in a cohesive and clean way ✅ 
- Program that is completely modularized ✅ 
     
 ## Conclusion:
      
- This project aims primarily at teaching new students from UFRN's Information Systems course or from anywhere in the world about the use of pure Python. The code is intended for the development of CRUDs with saving to binary files, but several other functionalities can be added to the source code.
- In this conversation, we discussed various aspects of a Python project aimed at developing CRUDs with binary file storage. We explored the definition of CRUD, methods used in the project, modern language formatting, use of classes, efficient data processing methods, modular and readable program design. We concluded that this project has significant value for beginner programming students and can be expanded to include additional functionality and resources.
